// This program is designed to calculate a factorial. A factorial is a mathematical concept.
// It is notated by an exclamation mark. Let's see an example : 4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24
// You start with the first number and the multiply it by ever positive integer smaller than that number.
// Another example : 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
// It gets big very quick, so there is a conditional statement here to control the input.
// We don't want the input to be too large because that might overwhelm the computer, or simply give us the wrong answer.

// The code doesn't work. Fix it!
